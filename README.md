# WCF-ProductServiceDemo
WCF is a framework, which is used for creating service where you can send the data from one end point to another.
In WCF developer can create one single service that can be consumed by two different clients- either they want same protocol or a different protocol.

* WCF consists of:
1- WCF Service : What is the service and what it is providing.
2- WCF Service host: Where is the Service hosted.
3- Service Client: Who is the client of the Service.

# Why WCF?
* Distributed Application
It means those Applications, which do not run only on single system but can run on multiple systems, which are connected over the network. For example, a Web Service that can consume by different clients.

* Interoperable
It means that an Application can consume or connect with another Application but it does not matter in which platform it is developed.
