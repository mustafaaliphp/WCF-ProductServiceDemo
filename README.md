# WCF-ProductServiceDemo
WCF is a framework, which is used for creating service where you can send the data from one end point to another.

# Why WCF?
Distributed Application

It means those Applications, which do not run only on single system but can run on multiple systems, which are connected over the network. For example, a Web Service that can consume by different clients.

Interoperable

It means that an Application can consume or connect with another Application but it does not matter in which platform it is developed.
